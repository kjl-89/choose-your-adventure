# Find Help

Your wife is gone. The person you dedicated your life to, snuffed out. You feel the grief pile on your shoulders. 😢
However, another feeling takes over.

**You must protect your daughter at all costs.**

You grab your daughter’s hands and head out into the night.

The street is in shambles – smoke, gunfire, and screams.

You spot a convoy of military trucks ahead.

Soldiers’ shouts
“We are evacuating to Zone 3!”
