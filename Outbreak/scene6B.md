# Find Help

The thought of losing your wife overwhelms you. 😢
But another feeling takes over.

**Protecting your daughter at all costs**

You grab your daughter’s hands and head out into the night.

The street is in shambles – smoke, gunfire, and screams.

You spot a convoy of military trucks ahead.

Soldiers’ shouts
“We are evacuating to Zone 3!”
