# The End

You fall to your knees in disbelief.
You have failed because of your decision to hide.

The gate gives way with metallic screech.

You whisper softly,

“I’m sorry.”

The horde rushes in.

Among the infected, your wife and daughter clamp down on you.
Pain floods your body as everything fades.

**You become infected.**

**THE END**
