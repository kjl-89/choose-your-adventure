# Failure and Regret

You slip behind the closest gated store and pull the barrier down.
The infected swarm into the hallway, slamming against the metal gate.

You gasp for air in relief.

Then- you see them. Time Slows!ğŸ¥˜

Among the infected you see your wife and daughter. Their faces pale, eyes white, pressing against the gate with the others.

Your decision to hide led to your family demise. 

Your heart shatters.ğŸ’”

You back away slowly as the gate starts to bend.

What do you do?

- [The end]

- [Leave them]
