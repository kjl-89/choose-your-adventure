# Quarantine Zone 3

After hours, the truck halts to a stop.

A massive barrier made of concreate and barbe wire.

"Welcome to Quarantine Zone 3, you are safe now" says a soldier.

They scan you and your daughter before letting you through.

A loudspeaker rings out:

"ALL new arrivals must report to med bay for screening"

Your daughter tell you she is not feeling well.

What do you do?
