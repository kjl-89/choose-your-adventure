# Quarantine Zone 3

After hours on the road, the truck halts to a stop.

Ahead stands a massive barrier of concreate and barbe wire.

"Welcome to Quarantine Zone 3, you are safe now" says a soldier.

They scan you and your daughter before allowing you through.

A loudspeaker rings out:

"ALL new arrivals must report to med bay for screening"

Your daughter tell you she is not feeling well.

What do you do?
