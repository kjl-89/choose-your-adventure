# Run to the parking lot to find your car

You run through the doors into the infested parking lot.
Your cars is a few rows back.

You're halfway to it when the alarm of a nearby car **goes off**

Dozens of infected snaps their heads toward it… then toward **you**.

You surge forward, zigzagging through abandoned cars and broken glass.
They're faster than you'd thought.

**Click! ** You leap inside and close the door just as the first infected smashes into the window.

The engine roars to life. You throw it in reverse and gun it out of the lot.
The streets are a mess; cars flipped, building on fire, and distant screams.
Smoke chokes the sky. The city is on fire.

you make it home.

Now what?
