# Time lost

You shove the maintenance door into a narrow service tunnel that led you back into the mall.

Because of your decision to hide, time slipped away.⏳

The mall is now quiet as the scream of fear diminishes. 

In desperation you call out for your wife and daughter. Your voice echoes throughout the empty hall.

A large horde of infected emerges.
