# Time Lost

You shove open the maintenance door and step into a narrow service tunnel that leads you back into the mall.

Because of your decision to hide, **time slipped away.** ‚è≥

The mall is now quiet now - the scream diminishes. 
You realize the silence is not peace... its the sound of everyone gone.

In desperation you call out for your wife and daughter. 
Your voice echoes throughout the empty hall.

**A large horde of infected emerges.**
