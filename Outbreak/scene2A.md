# Scene 2A: The Call

With trembling hands you pull out your phone and call your wife.

The phone rings once.. then twice..

Then.. She answers:
"BABE! Where are yo..." it cuts out "..GO HOME!" then the line drops.

Your battery flashes on the top right: **5% remaining.**

You look around you. The mall is in total disarray - Stores are looted, people fighting to get out.

What do you do?
