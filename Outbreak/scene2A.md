# Scene 2A: The Call

With trembling hands you pulled out your phone and call your wife.

The phone rings once..twice..

Then..She answers..
>"BABE!" Where are yo..."static"..GO HOME! "static" (phone cuts out.)

Your battery flashes at **5% remaining.**

You look around you. The mall is in total disarray - Stores looted, people fighting to get out.

What do you do?
