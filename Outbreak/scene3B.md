# Fight to find Family

In desperation to find your family.  You grab a hammer lying beside a shattered toolbox.🔨

You tear clothes off the racks of a nearby store, thinking to yourself: "The more layers, the better".

The infected are everywhere- clawing, screaming, stumbling throughout the mall towards you.

You swing the hammer wildly; every impact cracks against the head of every infected in your path.

You push forward, shouting your family’s names.
Through the chaos, you hear a faint scream. Could that be your wife and daughter?
