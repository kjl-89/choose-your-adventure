# Fight to find Family

In desperation to find your family.  You grab a hammer lying beside a shattered toolbox.🔨

You tear strips of fabric from a nearby clothing store and wrap them around your arms and legs for protection.

The infected are everywhere- clawing, screaming, stumbling throughout the mall towards you.

You swing the hammer wildly; every impact connects to the head of every infected in your path.

You push forward, shouting your family’s names.
Through the chaos, you hear a faint scream. Can that be your wife and kids?
