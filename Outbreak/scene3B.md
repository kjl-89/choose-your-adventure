# Fight to find Family

In desperation to find your family.  I managed to find a hammer lying beside a shattered toolbox.ðŸ”¨

You tear strips of clothing from a nearby clothing store and warp them around your arms and legs for protection.

The infected are everywhere- clawing, screaming and stumbling throughout the mall towards you.

You swing the hammer wildly; every impact connects to the head of every infected person in your way. 

You push forward, shouting your familyâ€™s names.
Through the chaos, you hear a faint scream. Can that be your wife and kids?

-[Go towards the scream, hoping it is your family]
