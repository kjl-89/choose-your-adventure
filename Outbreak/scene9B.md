# Pled for Help

You break free from the soldiers.

“Let go of my daughter! She’s not infected!” you shout.

The medic hesitates, voice trembling.

“She is infected. If we don’t act now, everyone is at risk.”

You dive towards your daughter, but the door **slam shut.**

You hit the glass, pounding, screaming her name.

Your daughter slowly disappears as white mist fills the chamber.
