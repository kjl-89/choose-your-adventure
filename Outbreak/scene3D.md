# End battle in the kitchen store

You fought well alongside the other, swinging anything, you can find. But there were too many of them.

You stumble backwards as one of the infected lunged at you.

You feel a sharp pain – “A BITE” 🧟‍♂️

Your vision blurs. The scream fades and you drop to the ground.

In seconds, you turn on your fellow mates not for help but for “FLESH”

**You have become infected**

**THE END**
