# End battle in the kitchen store

You fought alongside the other, swinging anything you can find. 

But there were too many of them.

You stumble backwards as one of the infected **lunges** at you.

You feel a sharp pain – “A BITE” 🧟‍♂️

Your vision blurs. The scream fades and you drop to the floor.

In seconds, you turn to your fellow mates not for help but for **FLESH**

**You have become infected**

**THE END**
