# EXIT STAFF DOOR

You and the others sprint towards the **STAFF ONLY** door, The hallway beyond is narrow, you can hear the infected 

screeching and screaming from people trying to escape.

You glance back just as the metal gate collapses, the infected floods in.

You grab at door handles along the hallway **ALL LOCKED** ðŸ”’

You turn to see your group dragged down, as the infected feast on their flesh. 

To your left â€“ a **maintenance door** with an EXIT sign.
