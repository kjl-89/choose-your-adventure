# EXIT STAFF DOOR

You and the others sprint towards the **STAFF ONLY** door

The hallway beyond is narrow, you can hear the infected 

screeching and screaming from people trying to escape.

You glance back just as the metal gate collapses, the infected **floods in**.

You grab at door handles along the hallway **ALL LOCKED** ðŸ”’

One by one, your group is dragged down, their screams cut short as the infected feast on their flesh. 

To your left â€“ a **maintenance door** with an EXIT sign.

You push through the door, praying for a way out.
