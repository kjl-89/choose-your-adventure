# Go with the Military

You lift your daughter into the truck. The soldier slams the door behind you.

Through the window, you see the city burning as the convoy speeds away.

A soldier mutters, "We are headed to the quarantine zone!"

You glace at your daughter in relif- exhausted, shaking and tired.
