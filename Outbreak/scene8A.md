# Med bay Screening

A medic takes a sample of blood from you and your daughter.
you step forward.
The scanner beeps and turns green.
"You are good to go sir!" says the medic

your daughter steps forward.
The scanner beeps and turns red. 
Her face drops. "Sir...she's infected."

Before you can react, soldiers grab you, and drag your daughter away.

What do you do?
