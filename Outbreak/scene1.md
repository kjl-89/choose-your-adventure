# Scene 1: Wisconsin

Our family was in the mall when everything started. I had stepped away to grab some food for us while my wife and daughter were running a couple extra errands.



All we wanted to do was have a nice lunch in the food court.



"My phone is really slow today." you think to yourself. Tons of chatter surrounds you, it's almost deafening.



Then one scream rings out, then another, and another.



Your phone floods with texts.



"What's going on? What's with all the screaming?"

"Where are you?"

"I'm with Emily, I can't find you in the crowds."

"Please respond, we need to get out of here."



You look up to see shoppers sprinting to the doors, a look of terror struck across all of their faces.



Two shoppers seem entangled on the floor, like some sort of fight was happening, but no security tried to stop it.



Then you see the blood, the look of death in the eyes of one of the shoppers, and you feel the lack of a soul. 



It wasn't a fight, it was an attack.



You notice the gaze of the attacker, filled only with a look of anger and starvation.



What do you do?
