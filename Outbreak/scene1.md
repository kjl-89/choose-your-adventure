# Scene 1: Wisconsin 

You and your wife and daughter were at the mall when it started. 
You sat at the food court, scrolling through your phone while your family shopped for the day. You noticed your phone slower than usual.

Then a scream echoed through the air.
To your surprise, you see a bystander being attacked. At first, you thought it was a fight...but at a closer look, you see the attacker biting and there was blood everywhere. Mall security quickly pinned the man to the floor.

You lock eyes with the attacker, his face pale, eyes clouded, and his bloody mouth twitching. 

In a split second, the injured bystander starts seizing and goes limp. Then it rises up and attacks Mall security.

Panic erupted. People scream and run in every direction.
Someone yell "DONT LET THEM BITE YOU!"

You look around - chaos everywhere.
