# Scene 1: Wisconsin 

You and your family were at the mall when it started. You sat at the food court, scrolling through your phone while your family shopped for the day. You noticed your phone slower than usual.

Then a scream echoed through the air.
To your suprise, you see a bystander being attack. At first, you thought it was a fight...but at a closer look, you see the attacker biting and there was blood everywhere. Mall security quickly pinned the man on the floor.

You locked eyes with the infected man, his face pale, eyes clouded, and his bloodly face twiching. 

In a split second the injured bystander started sezuring and went limp. Then it rose up and attacked Mall security.

Panic erupted. People screamed and ran in every direction.
You hear someone yelled "DONT LET THEM BITE YOU!"

You look around - chaos everywhere.
You can't see your family. 

what do you do?
