# Outbreak - Episode 1 : Infected Outbreak

## âš  City Lockdown

It all started on that very day. The outbreak that took the whole world by surprise. 

A failed experiment that leaked into our waters, and infected all ocean life and finally, into **us**.

It began with rabies-like symptoms: Confusion, aggression, and dementia. In the final stage -which takes seconds- the infected experience violent seizures before falling still.

Moments later, they "reawaken"..
No pain.
No fear.
Only hunger!

The battle for survival starts at the mall in **Wisconsin**
